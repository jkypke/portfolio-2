        <img src="assets/IMG_6597.jpg" style="width:250px;height:200px;">

            <p>Well, hello there. My name is Jessica Kypke and I am currently a student in a full stack web development program at the University of Texas at Austin. I am new to the web development world and couldn’t be more excited to get to everything there is to know about this wonderful career field. My professional background is in hospitality management. I started out as a barista at Jo’s Coffee, the best coffee shop in Austin, and worked my way up to Assistant General Manager. As an Assistant General Manager, one of my responsibilities is planning and executing events. It is always rewarding to think of an idea, organize and plan it from scratch and then watch it develop over time into a successful event. This is what drew me to web development; the feeling I have for creating something from nothing.</p>
    
            <p>Don’t worry, web development and coffee shops are not my only interests. When I have time off, you will find me in a small, 3lb tent more times than not. I am an avid camper, hiker and backpacker. My favorite places to camp are in South West Colorado and Northern New Mexico. Fun fact: The San Juan Mountains in South West Colorado have the largest cluster of 14’000ft peaks. Pretty cool, huh? One of my life goals is the climb all of them.</p>
